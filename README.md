# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb) that demonstrates how to build a machine learning model for detecting credit card fraud using Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and others.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze credit card transactions and predict whether they are fraudulent or legitimate based on historical transaction data. This is a critical task for financial institutions aiming to minimize losses due to fraudulent activities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

bash pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


### Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or any other compatible environment.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Data

The dataset used in this project simulates credit card transactions and includes both fraudulent and legitimate transactions. It is designed for educational purposes and may not reflect real-world scenarios accurately.

## Model Performance

This model was developed using Python and its libraries, achieving a remarkable 93% accuracy on test data. It effectively distinguishes between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, showcasing the power of logistic regression in identifying patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.
